  <p>
    Sponsoring Full Frontal means developers, designer, bloggers and more get to know your company better
    and shows that you support their community. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to promote your brand and
    products to attendees and potentially meet new employees, clients and users.
  <p class=last-child>
    There are also networking opportunities throughout the conference and during the after party.
    Find out how your company can sponsor Full Frontal by reviewing our <a href=/sponsorship.html>sponsorship packages</a>

    <!-- interesting bug in Firefox 3.6 - if you're using HTML5 elements, and you're not closing your HTML4 p tags, then the HTML5 element gets sucked in to the paragraph. Odd, eh? -->

      <p>The BlackBerry&reg; WebWorks&trade; SDK lets developers build rich, integrated, standalone BlackBerry applications using web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript). These applications allow full integration into the BlackBerry ecosystem and can be distributed and monetized like traditional applications running on the BlackBerry&reg; PlayBook&trade; tablet and BlackBerry smartphones.</p>
      <p>The BlackBerry WebWorks SDK v2.1 provides page load improvements and includes new features in BBM&trade; integration, push technology, device integration and security.</p>

      <p>Mozilla is a global, nonprofit organization dedicated to making the Web better. We emphasize principle over profit, and believe that the Web is a shared public resource to be cared for, not a commodity to be sold.
      <p>They work with an open community of developers building resources for a better web, regardless of brand, browser or platform. Anyone can contribute and each person who does makes us stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the Web to serve the greater good. It starts here, with you.
      <p>Mozilla have created Dev Derby, an HTML5 demo contest, to encourage developers to show off what is possible with HTML5.</p>
