    Sponsoring Full Frontal means developers, designer, bloggers and more get to know your company better
    and shows that you support their community. You’ll have the opportunity to promote your brand and
    products to attendees and potentially meet new employees, clients and users.
  <p class=last-child>
    There are also networking opportunities throughout the conference and during the after party.

    <!-- interesting bug in Firefox 3.6 - if you're using HTML5 elements, and you're not closing your HTML4 p tags, then the HTML5 element gets sucked in to the paragraph. Odd, eh? -->
